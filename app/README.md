# App Readme

## Assumptions

- No search button is required, user change should trigger search
- Extra long descriptions have been cut short for better aesthetics, a simple solution to cut on white space after max words is used
- An empty search is short circuited on app
- Although search input is throttled, it can lead to excessive calls in some cases if this happens please wait for few minutes before continuing.
- No effort has been made to make the app mobile friendly
